For any two pairs of students with rollnumbers say (i,n-i+1) and (j,n-j+1). if i is less than j then the pair (i,n-i+1) gave their gift before the pair (j,n-j+1)

Input Format -  First line contains N - Number of students.And second line contains N space seperated integers where ith number represents pocket money of student whose roll number is i.
		- Pocket money of students. 

Output Format - 3 space seperated integers where first integer denotes roll number of first student in the pair.
	        second integer denotes roll number of second student in the pair.
	        and last one denotes the cost of their gift.

Constraints - 1 <= N <= 10^5
		N is even.
           1 <= a1,a2,...,an <= 1000
